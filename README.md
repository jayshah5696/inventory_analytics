Tierra Del Fuego does not have a direct-to-consumer sales channel; instead, they rely upon brick-and-mortar and online retailers to sell their product. One of their key strategic customers is Pazzo’s, who is an online retailer that buys Tierra Del Fuego product in bulk and sells it to end consumers.

Pazzo’s places their orders once a week, every week on Monday for the current week. Depending on the inventory available at each of the DCs, Tierra Del Fuego chooses to accept the whole order quantity, or a part of the order quantity. Any part of the order not fulfilled is referred to as a cut. In certain weeks, the order quantity is unexpectedly high and Tiera Del Fuego does not have enough inventory to fulfill these orders.

The business problem: How can Tierra Del Fuego better fulfill Pazzo’s orders—even anomalous ones and prevent cuts? Tierra Del Fuego wants to capitalize on the business opportunity, which they miss if they do not have sufficient levels of inventory. However, at the same time, they do not want to overstock due to high carrying costs of inventory and the seasonable demand of their products.

My Solution was to predict the anomaly order 1 week before. I presentated my solution here in the pdf.
